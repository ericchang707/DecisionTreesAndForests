Although this will not be graded, we encourage you to use the notebook to learn more about the assignment. The sklearn (scikit-learn) library is used on this notebook, and will not be allowed to be used on the assignment. Do not call or use this library in your assignment submission file.\n",

Enter this command from your ai_env Terminal, ***conda install -c conda-forge python-graphviz*** which installs version 0.19 (compatible) if pip install does not work."
